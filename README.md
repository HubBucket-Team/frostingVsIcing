# frostingVsIcing

This data and code I used for analysis of lexical judgements on "frosting" and "icing". Data was collected in a Google form over two days and the data here has been sanatized a bit (mostly to make binning responses neater). Empty/joke responses have also been removed (ah, the joys of online data collection). 

This is mainly for my personal use so there are almost certainly typos in my comments. You've been warned!

A write up of  my analysis is also on my blog.
